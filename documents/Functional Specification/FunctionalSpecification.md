### 2. Localization strategy 

The following steps outline the localization strategy for the future version of "Green City":

#### a. Text externalization

- All in-game text, including dialogues, menus, and tooltips, will be stored in external resource files (e.g., JSON, CSV, or PO files). This ensures that translations can be easily added or updated without modifying the codebase.

#### b. Font and text formatting

- Fonts that support multiple character sets, such as Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts, will be used to ensure compatibility across languages.
- Text alignment and formatting will dynamically adapt to account for differences in word length and reading direction (e.g., right-to-left for Arabic).

#### c. Cultural relevance

- Icons, symbols, and examples will be reviewed to ensure they are culturally neutral and globally relatable.
- Environmental scenarios (e.g., renewable energy solutions) will include options relevant to different regions, such as solar power in sunny climates or wind turbines in coastal regions.

#### d. Voiceovers and audio

- If voiceovers are added in future versions, localized voice acting will be implemented. For the MVP, text-based subtitles will suffice.

### 3. Localization tools

To streamline the localization process, the following tools will be considered:

- **Crowdin** or **POEditor**: For collaborative translation management.
- **Godot's built-in localization system**: For handling multiple language files and dynamic text loading.

### 4. Testing and validation

Before releasing localized versions, the following will be tested:

- Text rendering and alignment for all supported languages.
- Consistency and accuracy of translations.
- User feedback to ensure translations are culturally and contextually appropriate.

### 5. Future plans

In future updates, localization may also include:

- Regional-specific tutorials or examples (e.g., explaining carbon offset programs common in Europe).
- Dynamic adaptation to local metrics (e.g., Celsius/Fahrenheit for temperature, kilometers/miles for distance).
- Broader language support based on user feedback and analytics.
