## Scope
This document copies all the weekly reports in a single document, providing a quick overview of the project’s goals, key accomplishments and challenges.


## Weekly Report - Week 1

### Overview

The week began with the presentation of the 7-week project, which focuses on creating a serious game. We had a conversation with the teacher to understand the expectations and requirements for the project.

### Goals

1. **First Brainstorm on the Game and What to Produce as a Serious Game:**
   - The main goal was to create a serious game centered around climate change. All team members discussed the type of game we would make and the climate change mechanics to include.

2. **Finalize the Project Concept:**
   - We decided to develop a city-building game. The player will make decisions on how to build the city, affecting the carbon footprint and CO2 emissions, which in turn impacts the climate.

3. **Study Climate Change:**
   - To create a sustainable city-building game, we studied the various causes of climate change and selected the aspects we would adapt for our game.

4. **Learn Godot:**
   - Godot is the game engine we will use to develop the game. None of the team members had prior experience with Godot.

### Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Brainstormed and decided on the type of serious game to produce.
- ✅ Finalized the project concept overview.
- ✅ Began learning Godot.

### Next Week

1. Hold a final meeting to decide what we will implement in our game.
2. Start and complete the README document.
3. Search for templates to use for building the game.
4. Start implementing the game design user interface.
5. Start and complete the project charter.
6. Begin working on the functional specifications document.

### Meeting & Collaborations

We held a meeting on Wednesday where we concluded on creating a sustainable city-building game. Guillaume Deramchi, the Technical Writer, proposed the city-building idea on the first day of school, and we had a brief discussion with the teacher who agreed with our project. It was left to us to decide on the game's mechanics and overall design.

### Other Notes

To conclude, the week started with a lot of passion and many ideas. All team members are eager to develop an educational game, and I hope things will continue to progress smoothly.


## Weekly Report - Week 2

### Overview

The week began with task planning. We focused on understanding the concept of climate change, identifying the key mechanics for our game, and determining what we will teach players, as it is a serious game.

### Goals

1. **Final Brainstorm:**
   - Outline key mechanics and educational goals.

2. **README Document:**
   - Assigned to Jason Grosso. Includes project links and team member roles.

3. **Templates for the Game:**
   - Manech Laguens and Victor Leroy are finding templates to save time.

4. **Game Design User Interface:**
   - Implement the game environment with trees and roads as a prototype starting point.

5. **Project Charter:**
   - Describe project goals, objectives, and resource requirements.

6. **Functional Specification Document:**
   - Outline project scope(what is the project all about). Due November 22, 2024. Handled by Guillaume Deramchi.

### Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Final Brainstorm
- ✅ README Document
- ✅ Templates for the Game
- ✅ Project Charter

### Next Week

1. Complete the functional specification document.
2. Have at least a visual representation of our game implemented.
3. Start the technical specification document.
4. Begin implementing the game prototype.
5. Start implementing the basic core mechanics of the game.

### Meeting & Collaborations

Final meeting decided to focus on the impact of CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint of infrastructure and transportation in a city. The game will show how player decisions affect the city's ecosystem.

### Other Notes

The week was productive, but we didn't meet all requirements due to limited project time. We will complete everything next week with available time.


## Weekly Report - Week 3

### Overview

This week, our main objective was to start the game prototype, aiming to have a visual representation of the game environment and, if possible, the game logic. Additionally, we worked on completing, and starting some essential documents.


### Goals

1. **Technical Specification Document:**
   - Assigned to Lucas Aubard. Responsible for explaining how the game will be built in the technical document.

2. **Start the Game Prototype:**
   - Manech Laguens, Victor Leroy, and Lucas Aubard are in charge of creating the first version of the prototype.
     - **Game Design User Interface:** Implement the game environment with buildings, trees and roads.
     - **Game Main Loop:** Create an inventory where players can select and place different buildings, and roads in the environment to make up the city.

3. **Functional Specification Document:**
   - Submit the functional document. Due November 22, 2024. Handled by Guillaume DERAMCHI.

4. **Test Plan Document:**
   - Begin drafting the test plan document.


### Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Started the game prototype.
- ✅ Completed the Functional Specification Document.


### Next Week

1. Complete the technical specification document.
2. Conduct unit tests.
3. Continue implementing the basic core mechanics of the game.
4. Continue improving the game UI.
5. Start drafting the User Manual.
6. Begin the Test Plan Document.


### Other Notes

The week was moderately productive. While we didn't complete all our goals, we exceeded expectations on the tasks we did complete. This delay does not affect the project deadlines, and we are on track.


## Weekly Report - Week 4

### Overview

We had three hours of project time this week, which was not enough to complete all our tasks.

### Goals

1. **Submit Technical Specification Document:**
   - Assigned to Lucas Aubard. Responsible for submitting the technical document before the deadline.

2. **User Manual:**
   - Assigned to Jason Grosso. Responsible for creating a user-friendly game guidebook to explain how the game functions.

### Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Completed the Technical Specification Document.

### Next Week

1. Conduct unit tests to ensure the game is bug-free.
2. Continue implementing the basic core mechanics of the game.
3. Continue improving the game UI.

### Other Notes

The week was not productive due to a lack of project time. We need to work over the weekend to catch up and meet deadlines. We have critical tasks running out of their due date that must be completed as soon as possible to avoid delays and potential issues later.


## Weekly Report - Week 5

## Overview

This week was not as productive as expected, and time is running out.

## Goals

1. **Submit Test Plan Document:**
   - Assigned to: Habi CAILLEAU
   - Responsibility: Submit the test plan document before the deadline.

2. **Refine Game Features Based on Feedback:**
   - For the next two weeks, gather feedback from testers and make improvements based on their input.

3. **Game Balancing:**
   - Over the next two weeks starting from this week, work on balancing the game mechanics.

4. **Game Optimization:**
   - Over the next two weeks starting from this week, focus on optimizing game performance.

## Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Completed and submitted the Test Plan Document.

## Next Week

1. Finalize all game features and deliver the product.
2. Continue refining game features based on feedback.
3. Complete game balancing.

## Other Notes

The week was less productive due to time constraints and a lack of engagement with the project. To address this, we have decided to adjust our initial goals and focus on delivering an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as the final product. This is necessary given the remaining time for this project.
