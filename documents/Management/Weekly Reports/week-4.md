## Overview

We had three hours of project time this week, which was not enough to complete all our tasks.

## Goals

1. **Submit Technical Specification Document:**
   - Assigned to Lucas Aubard. Responsible for submitting the technical document before the deadline.

2. **User Manual:**
   - Assigned to Jason Grosso. Responsible for creating a user-friendly game guidebook to explain how the game functions.

## Key Accomplishments

- âœ… Completed the Technical Specification Document.

## Next Week

1. Conduct unit tests to ensure the game is bug-free.
2. Continue implementing the basic core mechanics of the game.
3. Continue improving the game UI.

## Other Notes

The week was not productive due to a lack of project time. We need to work over the weekend to catch up and meet deadlines. We have critical tasks running out of their due date that must be completed as soon as possible to avoid delays and potential issues later.
