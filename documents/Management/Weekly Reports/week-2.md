## Overview

The week began with task planning. We focused on understanding the concept of climate change, identifying the key mechanics for our game, and determining what we will teach players, as it is a serious game.

## Goals

1. **Final Brainstorm:**
   - Outline key mechanics and educational goals.

2. **README Document:**
   - Assigned to Jason Grosso. Includes project links and team member roles.

3. **Templates for the Game:**
   - Manech Laguens and Victor Leroy are finding templates to save time.

4. **Game Design User Interface:**
   - Implement the game environment with trees and roads as a prototype starting point.

5. **Project Charter:**
   - Describe project goals, objectives, and resource requirements.

6. **Functional Specification Document:**
   - Outline project scope(what is the project all about). Due November 22, 2024. Handled by Guillaume Deramchi.

## Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Final Brainstorm
- ✅ README Document
- ✅ Templates for the Game
- ✅ Project Charter

## Next Week

1. Complete the functional specification document.
2. Have at least a visual representation of our game implemented.
3. Start the technical specification document.
4. Begin implementing the game prototype.
5. Start implementing the basic core mechanics of the game.

## Meeting & Collaborations

Final meeting decided to focus on the impact of CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint of infrastructure and transportation in a city. The game will show how player decisions affect the city's ecosystem.

## Other Notes

The week was productive, but we didn't meet all requirements due to limited project time. We will complete everything next week with available time.
