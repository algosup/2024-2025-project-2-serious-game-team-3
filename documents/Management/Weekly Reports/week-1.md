## Overview

The week began with the presentation of the 7-week project, which focuses on creating a serious game. We engaged in a conversation with the teacher to understand the expectations and requirements for the project.

## Goals

1. **First Brainstorm on the Game and What to Produce as a Serious Game:**
   - The main goal was to create a serious game centered around climate change. All team members discussed the type of game we would make and the climate change mechanics to include.

2. **Finalize the Project Concept:**
   - We decided to develop a city-building game. The player will make decisions on how to build the city, affecting the carbon footprint and CO2 emissions, which in turn impacts the climate.

3. **Studying Climate Change:**
   - To create a sustainable city-building game, we studied the various causes of climate change and selected the aspects we would adapt for our game.

4. **Learn GODOT:**
   - GODOT is the programming language we will use to develop the game. None of the team members had prior experience with GODOT.

## Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Brainstormed and decided on the type of serious game to produce.
- ✅ Finalized the project concept overview.
- ✅ Began learning GODOT.

## Meeting & Collaborations

We held a meeting on Wednesday where we concluded on creating a sustainable city-building game. Guillaume Deramchi the Technical Writer proposed the city-building idea on the first day of school, and we had a brief discussion with the teacher who agreed with our project. It was left to us to decide on the game's mechanics and overall design.

## Other Notes

To conclude, the week started with a lot of passion and many ideas. All team members are eager to develop an educational game, and I hope things will continue to progress smoothly.
