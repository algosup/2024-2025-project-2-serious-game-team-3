## Overview

The week began with the presentation of the 7-week project, which focuses on creating a serious game. We had a conversation with the teacher to understand the expectations and requirements for the project.

## Goals

1. **First Brainstorm on the Game and What to Produce as a Serious Game:**
   - The main goal was to create a serious game centered around climate change. All team members discussed the type of game we would make and the climate change mechanics to include.

2. **Finalize the Project Concept:**
   - We decided to develop a city-building game. The player will make decisions on how to build the city, affecting the carbon footprint and CO2 emissions, which in turn impacts the climate.

3. **Study Climate Change:**
   - To create a sustainable city-building game, we studied the various causes of climate change and selected the aspects we would adapt for our game.

4. **Learn Godot:**
   - Godot is the game engine we will use to develop the game. None of the team members had prior experience with Godot.

## Key Accomplishments

- ✅ Brainstormed and decided on the type of serious game to produce.
- ✅ Finalized the project concept overview.
- ✅ Began learning Godot.

## Next Week

1. Hold a final meeting to decide what we will implement in our game.
2. Start and complete the README document.
3. Search for templates to use for building the game.
4. Start implementing the game design user interface.
5. Start and complete the project charter.
6. Begin working on the functional specifications document.

## Meeting & Collaborations

We held a meeting on Wednesday where we concluded on creating a sustainable city-building game. Guillaume Deramchi, the Technical Writer, proposed the city-building idea on the first day of school, and we had a brief discussion with the teacher who agreed with our project. It was left to us to decide on the game's mechanics and overall design.

## Other Notes

To conclude, the week started with a lot of passion and many ideas. All team members are eager to develop an educational game, and I hope things will continue to progress smoothly.
