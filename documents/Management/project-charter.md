## 1. Project Title
EcoCity Builder

## 2. Project Overview

### Project Description
EcoCity Builder is a serious city-building game that focuses on the impact of urban development on climate change. Players are tasked with building and managing a city while addressing two key sources of CO2 emissions and carbon footprint: buildings and transportation. The game aims to educate players on how urban planning decisions can reduce the carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable environment, while also highlighting how urbanization can have a significant negative impact on the city.

### Project Objectives
- Develop a simulation game that provides an engaging and educational experience about the impact of urban planning on climate change.
- Highlight the effects of CO2 emissions and carbon footprint from residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.
- Showcase the impact of various transportation choices, including public transport, electric vehicles, and road infrastructure, on CO2 emissions and carbon footprint.
- Encourage players to make decisions that balance economic growth with environmental sustainability.
- Create an engaging game where player choices have consequences on the sustainability of the city, thereby teaching players from their mistakes or reinforcing correct choices to find the right balance.

## 3. Project Scope

### In-Scope
- Core gameplay focused on city-building mechanics, including constructing buildings and developing transportation networks.
- Implementation of a pollution and CO2 emission system based on the type and number of buildings and transport modes.
- Dynamic visual representation of pollution levels in the city environment (e.g., smog, air quality index).
- A bar at the top left of the screen representing the percentage of CO2 emissions and carbon footprint.
- Educational aspects that show players the environmental impact of their decisions, encouraging sustainable choices.
- User interface (UI) elements that provide feedback on CO2 levels, carbon footprint, and overall environmental health, and detailed information on each building.

### Out-of-Scope
- Detailed simulation of other climate change factors like deforestation, agricultural impact, or waste management.
- Multiplayer or online features.
- Extensive customization options for buildings and transport beyond predefined templates.
- Focusing mostly on a game rather than the main goal, which is a serious game.

## 4. Project Goals and Success Criteria

### Goals
- Create an engaging and educational city-building experience focused on climate change and sustainability.
- Develop mechanics that realistically simulate the impact of CO2 emissions and carbon footprint from buildings and transport on climate health.
- Implement a feedback system that informs players of their environmental impact and encourages sustainable decision-making.

### Success Criteria
- The game successfully demonstrates the correlation between building types, transport choices, and CO2 emissions and carbon footprint.
- Positive feedback from playtesting sessions, showing player engagement and increased awareness of sustainable urban planning.
- The game is truly educational.
- Data used in the game should be accurate and not estimated.
- Completion of the project within the 7-week timeline, ready for submission and presentation.

## 7. Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies
 | Risk                                     | Impact    | Mitigation Strategy                                                 |
 |------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Limited Time Frame                       | High      | Prioritize core features and focus on essential mechanics related to CO2 emissions and carbon footprint. |
 | Complexity of CO2 Emission Calculations | Medium    | Simplify the pollution model while maintaining realism and focus on two main factors: buildings and transport. |
 | Technical Challenges with UI Implementation | Medium | Allocate time for iterative testing and UI feedback.               |
 | Low Player Engagement with Educational Content | Medium | Incorporate engaging feedback systems and rewards for making sustainable choices. |
 | Game Balance                             | High      | Conceive the game in such a way that each decision the player makes doesn't have a big impact on the flow of the game. |
 | Creating a game and not a serious game   | High      | Focus first on what you want to teach to people, then think on how you will implement that in the game. |
 | Educational Aspect                      | High      | Deep research is essential on the thematic that will be taught to players; no random information, actual real value will be used to make the game. |
