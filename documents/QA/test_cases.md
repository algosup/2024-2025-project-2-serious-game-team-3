## Overview

A test case is a structured document outlining specific scenarios or procedures to be tested within a software or system. Its purpose is to ensure that the software functions correctly and reliably, allowing for seamless production use without encountering significant bugs. In this document five types of test will be executed : 

- Gameplay Test Cases
