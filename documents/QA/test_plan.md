<br> 

### 2. Test case Execution

The following structure will be used for Green City, with a dedicated template for each test case:



| Test Case ID | 28 |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Name of the test case |
| Description | Description of the test case |
| Pre-conditions | Requirements for the test |
| Steps | Steps to go from the current state to the expected result |
| Expected Result |Actual result of the test (could differ from what's expected) |
| Status | Status of the test (To Test , Testing , Tested )  |
| Importance | Defines if a test is important or not. Using symbols : Low / Medium / High |

<br>


After executing each test, its status (implemented, not implemented, non-working) will be documented and stored in a separate 
repository. You can access the detailed results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o72AQQnd1AdfZWMCfOFAuP_46ZYQdUdQIkkkEWEdWik/edit?gid=0#gid=0).


### 3. GitHub issue management

Efficient issue management is crucial for tracking bugs, documenting improvements, and ensuring smooth development workflows. 
In Green City, GitHub's issue management system has been set up with standardized templates to ensure consistency, clarity, and 
efficiency when reporting and addressing issues. This process helps streamline communication between developers, testers, and 
stakeholders, ensuring timely resolution of problems and documentation updates.

**a. Issue Creation:**

- Contributors create an issue using the appropriate template (Bug Report or Documentation Report).
- All fields are filled with detailed, relevant information to provide a clear understanding of the problem or update needed.

<br>

**b. Labeling and Categorization:**

- Issues are tagged with relevant labels (bug, documentation, enhancement) to categorize them.
- Importance levels help prioritize which issues need immediate attention.

<br>

**c. Assignment:**

- Issues are assigned to specific team members based on their expertise or current workload.
- Unassigned issues are reviewed during regular team meetings to ensure they donâ€™t go unnoticed.

<br>

**d. Resolution and Tracking:**

- Developers or documentation specialists work on resolving the issue.
- Updates on the issueâ€™s status (To Do, In Progress, Resolved) are tracked on the GitHub board.
- Automated notifications ensure that all stakeholders stay informed of progress.

<br>

**e. Review and Closure:**

- Once the issue is resolved or the documentation is updated, the solution is reviewed by a peer or QA tester.
- Upon validation, the issue is closed, and any relevant comments or changes are documented for future reference.

<br>

Here are the templates used during the project :

**Bug report template (relate to typos):**
<img src="..\QA\Images\Bug_template.png" alt="Bug Template"/>

**Documentation report template (relate to typos):**
<img src="..\QA\Images\Doc_template.png" alt="Doc Template"/>


### V. Testing outcomes

Test criteria regulate all testing activities, ensuring consistency and quality. In the Green City project, we will use two key types: Suspension Criteria and Exit Criteria.

#### 1. Suspension criteria

Suspension criteria establish the conditions under which all testing activities must be temporarily halted. This prevents wasted effort when critical issues compromise the validity of ongoing tests.

- Testing will be suspended if a critical defect or blocker is found that prevents the execution of further test cases (For Instance, if a core functionality such as building placement causes the game to crash repeatedly, testing will be suspended until the issue is resolved )

- Once the defect is addressed, testing will resume from the point of suspension, ensuring comprehensive coverage without missing crucial steps


#### 2. Exit criteria

Exit criteria are predefined goals or conditions that must be met to conclude a test phase successfully. These criteria ensure that the system meets the necessary quality standards before progressing to the next phase.

- Quantitative Goals: For a feature to move from the testing phase to release, specific benchmarks must be met.
    - 92% of all critical test cases must pass before a feature is deemed suitable for customer release.

- Qualitative Goals: No high-priority bugs should remain unresolved, and all major functionalities ( resource management, pollution tracking) must operate as expected.

- Documentation: All test outcomes must be documented, and the test status must be clearly recorded to ensure transparency.

## VI.Measure testing

These metrics ensure that the software quality meets expectations and the development process remains on track :

<br>

1. Defect Density

**Formula:**

$$
\text{Defect Density} = \frac{\text{Total Defect Count}}{\text{Size of the Release (lines of code)}}
$$

Lower defect density indicates higher code quality. This metric helps identify problematic modules or components.

<br>

2. Test Coverage

**Formula:**

$$
\text{TestÂ Coverage ( percent ) } = \frac{\text{NumberÂ ofÂ RequirementsÂ MappedÂ toÂ TestÂ Cases}}{\text{Total number of requirements}} * 100
$$

Measures the extent to which requirements are tested. Higher test coverage reduces the likelihood of undetected defects.

<br>

3. Defect Detection Efficiency (DDE)

**Formula:**

$$
\text{DDE ( percent ) } = \frac{\text{DefectsÂ DetectedÂ DuringÂ Testing}}{\text{TotalÂ NumberÂ ofÂ Defects}} * 100
$$

Indicates the effectiveness of testing in catching defects before release. Higher DDE means fewer defects escape into production.


## VII. Conclusion 

The Green City testing plan outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring the game's quality, educational value, and performance. By systematically validating core functionalities, educational integrity, and user experience, this plan guarantees that the game effectively meets its goals of teaching sustainability through engaging gameplay.

Key testing metrics such as Defect Density, Test Coverage, and Defect Detection Efficiency (DDE) provide measurable insights into code quality, requirement validation, and testing effectiveness. Establishing clear Suspension and Exit Criteria ensures that critical defects are addressed promptly, and testing phases conclude only when predefined quality standards are met.

Through rigorous manual and automated testing, coupled with efficient defect management via GitHub, Green City aims to deliver a stable, user-friendly, and educational experience, preparing it for a successful launch and positive impact on its audience.
