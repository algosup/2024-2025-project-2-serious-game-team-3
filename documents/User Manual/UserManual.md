## Improving the City

When you start the game, you arrive in a city halfway between industry and ecology.

It is your decisions that will influence the direction this city will take.

Your decision will come in the form of ameliorations that you will give to the different building of your city.

### Ameliorations

Amelioration come in two "flavor":

- Major to medium increase in money generation with a major to medium increase in CO2 production.
- Medium to small increase in money generation with a small to negative increase in CO2 production.
